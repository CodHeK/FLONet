# FLONet

A tech-blogging-social-network that enables people to learn a particular tech topic in a streamlined manner.<br>

Through this product we want to redefine the concept of social networking by making it more productive. Social networks are usually considered unproductive and we want to change that notion. We at FreeFlo strongly believe that social networks can be used in a productive manner provided the intentions of the creator are not to make it that way. Also, this would serve as a perfect marketing platform for tech startups and e-learning giants to market their products, content, courses and features. <br>

Aims at helping at the learning and tech communities.
